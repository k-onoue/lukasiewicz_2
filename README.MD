# Logically Constrained Predictive Models for Tabular Data

This software package provides a framework for extracting logical constraints from tabular data, building predictive models incorporating these constraints, and evaluating the models. It is built on top of CVXPY, a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems.
